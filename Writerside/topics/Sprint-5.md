## Sprint goal

Goals of this sprint:
- Minor refactor;
- CI enhancement;
- Robots.txt management;
- Crawler and Scraper termination.

## Sprint deadline
07/07/2024

## Sprint review

All goals have been fulfilled. CI enhancement involved strict rules about push requirements on main branches.

## Sprint retrospective
This sprint focused on filling backlog tasks of crawler and scraper entities. Delay on these entities was due to thin and tricky design of results class.
