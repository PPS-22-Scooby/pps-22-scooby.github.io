# Retrospective

In general, adopting SCRUM principles and mostly split the workload in sprints has been a useful practise that allowed
a fair load balancing; further details of each sprint will be depicted in <a href="Backlog.md">Backlog</a> section.

I found this project fascinating due to an interesting goal, an inspirational team and project structure and requirements.
The relevance granted to all methodologies that surround works allowed me to correctly structure workload and to gain
the best time efficiency in team work, resulting in high motivation, expressed looking for the best solutions to deal
with faced problems.
Moreover, this project has been useful also for consolidating knowledge about Scala language and functional programming
paradigm, expressed in terms of design and implementation.
Personally, I'm satisfied with the tasks I fulfilled and effort took.  

## Future developments

- A GUI could be implemented as matter of both usability and simulation status, as well as a more effective export output;
- Stop and resume simulation mechanisms could be implemented;
- DSL could be enhanced collecting users suggestions;
- Workarounds to prevent anti-scraping measures could be made, involving some A.I. techniques;
- Publish library on Maven repository, to provide an easier integration.
