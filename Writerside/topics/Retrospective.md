# Retrospective

In general, adopting SCRUM principles and mostly split the workload in sprints has been a useful practise that allowed
a fair load balancing; further details of each sprint will be depicted in <a href="Backlog.md">Backlog</a> section.

## Luca Rubboli

I found this project fascinating due to an interesting goal, an inspirational team and project structure and requirements.
The relevance granted to all methodologies that surround works allowed me to correctly structure workload and to gain
the best time efficiency in team work, resulting in motivation to look for the best solutions to deal with faced
problems.

Personally, I'm satisfied with my project work and effort.
