# Backlog

In this section all the activities will be listed in a detailed fashion, splitting them temporarily in sprint. For 
doing this Youtrack was used in order to register both the estimated and the effective time spent on each activity.

Youtrack already provides an easy way to export the task data in a CSV format which later on has been enriched by adding
the backlog item column.
