## Sprint goal

The goals of this sprint are:

- Setting up the project environment and all the development tools needed
- Write a simple prototype of the main entities of the project

## Sprint deadline
16/06/2024

## Sprint review
The tasks were completed on time and no tasks were left behind. A simple prototype of the main entities is ready and can 
be taken as a starting point for the next sprints.

## Sprint retrospective
Here we've overstimated the time needed for complete the task, in particular, for cucumber tests definition. This is due to the fact that the team is not yet familiar with the tools and the technologies used in the project, and we've counted
also the time needed to learn them.
