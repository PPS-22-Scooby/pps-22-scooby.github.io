- Definition and implementation of Crawler;
- Definition and implementation of Scraper;
- Implementation of the Result and Rules classes.

## Sprint deadline

23/06/2024

## Sprint review
Unfortunately, lots of task have been left behind, we focussed in particular on the implementation of the utilities classes and we didn't have enough time to implement the main classes.

## Sprint retrospective
In this case we've underestimated the time needed for the implementation of the utilities classes, in particular for the Result class. We've also faced some problems with the implementation of the Rules class, which was more complex than expected. We will try to improve the time management in the next sprint.
